								<h3>Why Place Names Matter</h3>
								<p style="text-align: left">"Place-names are an important part of our geographical and cultural environment. They identify geographical entities of different kinds and represent <b>irreplaceable cultural values</b> of vital significance to people's sense of well-being and feeling at home. Place-names are therefore of <b>major social importance</b>. Society must also bear the responsibility for taking care of the place-name heritage and seeing to it that place-name planning is carried out in such a way that the functionality of the place-name stock is preserved and the <b>cultural heritage</b> is protected in a rapidly changing society." (NORNA-rapporter 13, p. 211) </br></br>
								The names that we give places, matter. Names can carry on the stories of the past, and along with their use, they also represent our present and future.</br></br>
								Washington's prominent Cascade Volcanoes represent many aspects of the state and the people that both previously and currently reside in it. The five volcanoes (from north to south) are most commonly (<b>and federally</b>) recognized as Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount St. Helens. These peaks may represent one person's dreams of winter skiing or another's inspiration for outdoor recreation, but to many of Washington's American Indian Tribes, they represent life itself.<br/><br/>

								The tallest mountain of North America is located in Alaska. The peak was unofficially named Mount McKinley by a gold prospector in 1896 and the name was federally adopted in 1917; however, the peak had many names that had been used in the state for generations. The local Koyukon Athabaskan name for the mountain, used by the Indigenous Americans, is <i>Dinale</i> or <i>Denali</i>, meaning "the high one." The locals still used the Indigenous name, so in 1975, the state of Alaska requested that the mountain be officially recognized as Denali. Due to conflict in opinions around the country, the name change was not pushed until August of 2015.</br></br>

								In this short video, writer Ernestine Hayes of Alaska, prompts her audience to step into the shoes of American Indians and to imagine how those of non-Native descent would feel if the culture, names, and languages that are prominently used/understood/acknowledged in our everyday lives were stripped and replaced by new settlers...<br/><br/>
							  <b>"Mountains are suseptible to the colonial practice of naming after settlers and their desendents..."</b><br/><br/></p>

							</br></br><p><b>"What would happen if in the space of the next few years, this American culture was suddenly subdued by another culture that believed theirs was a superior way of living, their language the only worthwhile speech, their history the only history that mattered... what would happen if this young American society, less than 250 years old, was rocked by cultural trauma?"</b></p>

								<h3>Washington has 29 Federally-Recognized American Indian Tribes</h3>
								<p>Each has existed in the present-day United States hundreds of years before European colonization. These groups of people had names for places that we inhabit and use today. These names contain their history and stories of nature, culture and survival. These names were then stripped away and replaced by white settlers.</p>

								<h3>Federal Land Mangement Agencies should be using Indigenous Place Names.</h3>
								<p>If federal land  management agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service included Indigenous place names (at least until they are fully reestablished), then this will cause recreationalists and users of the land to acknowledge and learn about Indigenous culture and history.</p>

								<h3>Why does Indigenous Place name use at the Federal level matter?</h3>
								<p>Federal name changes, as we have seen, take a long time. The state of Alaska officially recognized the Indigenous name of Denali, but it wasn't until 40 years later that the name was changed throughout federal documents. Symbolically, federal recognition will make the greatest impact in our culture by showing that the country is trying to make positive changes to recognize the toxicity of colonialism.</p>

									<h2><i>HOW</i> can we get Indigenous place names to be used?</h2>
									<p style="text-align: left">Getting geographic names changed at the Federal level takes a lot of time and effort. Geographic names are determined by the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names", target=_blank>U.S. Board on Geographic Names</a>. Write to your local ranger districts and federal land management agency head quarter offices and implore them to improve Indigenous cultural education in their information centers and ranger stations. Request that they (at the very least) <i>include</i> Indigenous place names in their publications until the names are Federally changed. For now, the most important thing to do is educate ourself on Washington's Indigenous history and culture. Below are two maps: one showcasing the history behind the federally-recognized names of the five most prominent peaks in Washington State and the other with the same peaks marked with one of their many American Indian names, cultural significance, and history.</p>
